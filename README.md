## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The analysis is divided into multiple tasks:

### Task 1: Data Importing and Exploration
- Imported HR dataset and explored its structure and size.  
- Observed dataset features related to satisfaction, working hours, salary, and retention (`left`).  

### Task 2: Data Exploration and Visualization
- Compared **satisfaction levels** between employees who stayed vs. left.  
- Analyzed **average monthly hours** and its relation to attrition.  
- Studied **salary levels** and how they influence retention.  
- Created visualizations (boxplots, count plots).  

### Task 3: Predictive Modeling
- Built a **Logistic Regression model**.  
- Standardized features using **StandardScaler**.  
- Split data into training/testing sets.  
- Evaluated model performance and accuracy.  

### Conclusions
- Employees with **low satisfaction** are more likely to leave.  
- Employees working **higher monthly hours** tend to leave more.  
- Employees with **low salary** show higher attrition rates.  
- Logistic Regression provides a baseline predictive model for attrition.
